   cp -r argocd/ ../staywell-manager-gitops/
   ```

2. **Update GitHub Secrets**
   ```bash
   # Add required secrets to GitHub repository
   gh secret set GITOPS_TOKEN --body "your-github-token"
   ```

3. **Deploy to Kubernetes**
   ```bash
   # Development deployment
   make k8s-dev-deploy
   
   # Production deployment (after testing)
